In the second Communication on Brexit preparedness from 13 November 20181, the Commission had:   called upon Member States to include the periods of legal residence in an EU27 Member State prior to the withdrawal when assessing if a UK national fulfils the 5 years of residence condition; recommended that Member States accept applications for residence permits that are submitted in advance of the UK’s date of withdrawal. In addition, UK nationals who are family members of EU citizens having exercised the right to free movement will enjoy the right to move and reside in an EU Member State, and may receive a “Residence card of a family member of a Union citizen”....\n",
